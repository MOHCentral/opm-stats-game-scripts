## Aliases

These event types are normalized to their canonical form at ingest:

| Alias | Canonical Type |
|-------|----------------|

## Usage in .scr Files

```morpheus
// ============================================================================
// VALID EVENT TYPES - Use these with build_base_payload
// ============================================================================

// Combat events
local.payload = waitthread global/tracker_common.scr::build_base_payload "kill"
local.payload = waitthread global/tracker_common.scr::build_base_payload "headshot"
local.payload = waitthread global/tracker_common.scr::build_base_payload "damage"

// Movement events
local.payload = waitthread global/tracker_common.scr::build_base_payload "jump"
local.payload = waitthread global/tracker_common.scr::build_base_payload "crouch"

// Match lifecycle
local.payload = waitthread global/tracker_common.scr::build_base_payload "match_start"
local.payload = waitthread global/tracker_common.scr::build_base_payload "match_end"
```

## Notes

1. **`player_kill` is normalized to `kill`** at the API layer
2. Always use the canonical type when querying ClickHouse
3. SMF/PHP code should use `EventTypes::KILL` constant, not string literals
